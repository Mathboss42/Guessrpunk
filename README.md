## How well do you know night city?

Guessrpunk is an attempt to emulate 'Guessr' style gameplay within the world of Cyberpunk 2077. Try to achieve the highest score possible over the course of 5 rounds!

This is a quick project I've slapped together over a few days. Images are stitched together from screenshots taken in-game using Microsoft ICE and may have artifacts or distortion in some places depending on the quality of the stitch. Written (sloppily) in React / NextJS
